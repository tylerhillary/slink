                            <p>Slink is a professional skill exchange operated by <strong>Radius Technology</strong>. Our platform lets learners register for skills, allows community members to list the skills they can teach, and routes enquiries through our concierge teams. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and share information when you visit slink.ng, submit registration or contact forms, or interact with any Slink experience that links to this policy (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
                            <p>By using the Services you agree to the practices described below. If you disagree with this policy, please refrain from using Slink and contact us so we can address your concerns.</p>
                        </article>

                            <h3>2.1 Information You Provide</h3>
                            <p>We collect information that you voluntarily submit, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Skill registration data:</strong> Full name, email address, age, gender, state, the skill you would like to learn, and the skills you indicate you can teach. This data is captured through the Skill Registration form and stored in our Firebase Firestore “registrations” collection. If you enter a new teachable skill, the skill name is also recorded so it can appear in our skill catalogue.</li>
                                <li><strong>Contact desk tickets:</strong> Name, work email, phone/WhatsApp, topic, subject, and message submitted through the concierge ticket form. These records are saved to the Firestore “contactSubmissions” collection to track and fulfil support requests.</li>
                                <li><strong>Email correspondence:</strong> If you reach us through the CEO inbox, partnerships desk, or other email links, we receive any details you include in that correspondence.</li>

                                <li>Device and connection data such as IP address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers.</li>
                                <li>Usage insights including pages viewed, selected skills, timestamped events, and referral URLs which help us understand feature adoption and tutor counts.</li>
                                <li>Local storage entries (for example, the skill you last selected and your partially completed registration) to streamline your experience during a session.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>2.3 Information from Service Providers</h3>
                            <p>We rely on Firebase (Google) for hosting, Firestore databases, and analytics. These providers may receive basic usage information in order to deliver their services and provide us aggregated performance metrics.</p>
