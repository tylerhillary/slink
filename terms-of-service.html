                            <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Slink, a skill exchange operated by <strong>Radius Technology</strong>. By visiting slink.ng, submitting a skill registration, offering a teachable skill, or contacting our concierge teams, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Services.</p>
                            <p>We may update these Terms to reflect platform changes, regulatory requirements, or operational improvements. When updates are material, we will post the revised Terms with a new “Last Updated” date and, when appropriate, provide direct notice. Continued use of Slink after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

                            <p>Slink curates mentorship introductions. Learners select skills, submit registrations, and see tutor availability counts. Community members list teachable skills; when a new skill is added it appears as a dynamic card for future learners. Operations specialists review every submission before confirming a match.</p>
                            <p>Radius Technology facilitates introductions but does not employ mentors, guarantee educational outcomes, or manage payments on the website. Any payment arrangements are handled directly with our concierge team outside the public site. You are responsible for the accuracy of what you present and for fulfilling commitments made to other users.</p>
